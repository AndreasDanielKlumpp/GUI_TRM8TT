 *     - Fixed severe string termination bug in handling lists of
 *       strings.
 *     - Fixed mechanism for waiting on grandchild ecasound process to exit.
 * 2003-12-24 Michael Ewe
 *     - Fixed signaling issues on FreeBSD. Modified to perform a
 *       double-fork to better decouple ECI stack and the ecasound
 *       engine process.
 * 2002-10-04 Kai Vehmanen
 *     - Rewritten as a standalone implementation.
 * 2001-06-04 Aymeric Jeanneau
