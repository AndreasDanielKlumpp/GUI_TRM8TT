### B) INSTALL

- Copy Source into (replace [username]): /home/[username]/GUI_TRM8TT

- mark all .sh and .desktop files as executables

- ./INSTALL.sh

- Edit Desktop file (GUI_TRM8TT.desktop):

replace [username] in:

Exec=/home/[username]/GUI_TRM8TT/GUI_TRM8TT %F 

Icon=/home/[username]/GUI_TRM8TT/32_32.png 

(To start GUI_TRM8TT via command (debug output in terminal): /home/[username]/GUI_TRM8TT/GUI_TRM8TT)


### C) FIRST TIME USE

Set sampling rate/frames/period/buffer... in JACK e.g. via QjackCtl (GUI_TRM8TT will start JACK automatically with the saved settings). Bit depth: 24 bit.

GUI_TRM8TT is creating helper .sh files inside of the GUI_TRM8TT folder (Message: 'Please restart your PC, mark all GUI_xTRM8TT_exit.sh or GUI_xTRM8TT_restart.sh files as executables and restart the program.'). Without these executable files GUI_TRM8TT will not work.

Create/select a 'tape' folder (it is possible to import mono .wav files with the same sampling rate as the Jack session (24 bit). Only files with the names Track_1.wav until Track_8.wav are recognized as active tracks (instead of deleting track files, tracks can be renamed e.g. Track_1_Take1.wav).

Select the midi CC controller (Settings) and restart GUI_TRM8TT.

Assignment of a set of 8 CC faders/knobs to volume or balance:

To map volume faders:
Create with a text editor inside of /home/[username]/GUI_TRM8TT a file with the name "vol_map", enter the first midi CC number (e.g. "1"), save and close the file (now midi CC 1 to 8 are assigned as volumne faders).

To map panning knobs:
Create inside of /home/[username]/GUI_TRM8TT a file with the name "pan_map", enter the first midi CC number (e.g. "10"), save and close the file (now midi CC 10 to 17 are assigned as panning knobs).

If no vol_map or pan_map files are inside of the folder, the following values are used: int vol_map = 1; int pan_map = 10; (= Behringer XTouchCompact Layer A)

'Transport function': Midi note (Controller)
'<<': 49
'>>': 50
'RTZ': 51
'STOP': 53
'>':54
(= Behringer XTouchCompact default settings)

Midi channel = Channel 1
